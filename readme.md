temporarily abandoned so I can learn how to build robust software without dealing with vulkan/gpu at the same time


requres odin compiler and slang compiler

dependencies = {
    [vulkan](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home),
    [sdl3](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL),
    [odin-vma](https://github.com/Capati/odin-vma),
}

I dont have a build script for the dependencies yet.
